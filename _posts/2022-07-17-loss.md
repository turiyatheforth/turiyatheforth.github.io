hiking on a mountain\
i saw a tibetan monk\
burning a dark maroon robe\
as others hauled\
supplies for a funeral\
an ominous sign\
i thought\
and sat near the edge\
looking at the flags\
whirling in the cold air\
framing the mighty Beas\
in the distance\
flowing\
as it has flown\
eternally\
\
i came down\
and marveled\
at the snow clad peaks\
from the backyard\
of my house\
how permanent these mountains\
they have stood for so long\
with countless human experiences\
buried deep inside them\
they’ll continue to stand\
as you and i and everyone else\
are long gone\
and scattered all over\
\
the next morning\
everyone standing\
around your ashes\
ground scalding hot\
from the fire\
which engulfed you\
and all of us\
they pour buckets of water\
to cool it down\
for us to comb through it\
to scavenge little pieces\
of your bones\
only the savagest\
could come up\
with a ritual like that\
\
i hope to see you\
in my dream\
twenty years later\
weary\
napping to a sunset\
on a beach\
\
i’d get to see your warm smile\
again\
you’d tell me about\
the places you’ve been to\
people you’ve met\
experiences you’ve had\
since\
\
i’d tell you about\
how at every joyous moment\
i’ve had\
i asked myself\
if i’d give it all away\
to get you back\
and the answer was always obvious\
\
i’d touch your soft hands\
say goodbye\
and hold you close\
till i become a dream myself\
on that beach\
shrouded in the red\
of the dusk
