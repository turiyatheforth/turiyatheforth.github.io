a cloudy night\
high from the rooftop\
you can see\
a tower with a blinking light\
red. white. red. white.\
\
she’s tipsy but not drunk\
eyes locked at the blinking light\
her table full of faceless heads\
and empty glasses\
talking about inane things\
\
remembering all those stories\
she wants to share\
\
the grueling pain\
you've felt in every cell\
second by second\
as your chest hurts\
and it’s difficult to breathe\
or happiness\
which seemed like\
it’d last forever\
\
but only words come out\
how terribly lonely\
each one of us\
on this earth\
to have experienced so much\
and nothing to show for it\
except words\
\
as the tables get deserted\
a plane flies across the sky\
a bird jumps from the ledge\
and flies into the night\
red. white. red. white.
