its 3am on a quiet residential street\
people have either left\
or passed out\
\
that was fun\
she says\
to dim yellow lights\
and empty cups\
\
a sofa here\
to cuddle with\
a painting there\
to describe her dreams to\
\
itâ€™s a comforting place\
small\
but enough\
\
all the things she could do here\
let her hair chase her face\
to the tune\
as the world outside\
is lit on fire\
\
dream of love found\
and friends made\
of laughs that make you cry\
and moments\
that touch life\
\
she wipes her lipstick on a paper\
lets her hair loose\
abandons her shoes\
\
and you can hear the music\
getting louder and louder\
on the street
