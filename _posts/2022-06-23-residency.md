end of a warm day in upper Dharamshala\
with the sun\
making every living thing\
dance to its blood red tune\
as it goes into slumber\
\
her hair streaked\
pink and green\
battle with the ever glowing red of the dusk\
\
she stands on the ledge looking down\
on the village below\
hills and cliffs\
full of tall oak trees\
ready to pierce the world\
\
it’s been a month since she came here\
after a spirit crushing residency\
walking\
climbing\
listening\
thinking\
talking but not a lot\
\
it’s finally over\
she says to no one\
it’s done\
and lets out a warm breath\
as the Universe prepares\
for the next big thing\
\
it’s almost dark\
a gush of breeze makes her hair run\
for her face\
and the lights in the village start twinkling\
like a mirror placed under a\
cold Himalayan night
