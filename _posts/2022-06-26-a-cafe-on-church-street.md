there she was\
sitting in a cafe\
in company of her poems\
not like tables full of lonely faces\
\
a smile so warm\
her notebook fierce\
hair ready to leap\
and shadow your face\
in their grace\
\
she gifted me these words\
and i almost bought her a rose\
\
i wonder\
if sheâ€™s humming a tune\
and laughing the same laugh\
right now\
\
as i pen this down\
thinking\
should i ask her\
aavengi, ja nahin?
